Pandas:

* Ratio scale:
    - units are equally spaced
    - mathematical operations of + - / * are all valid
    - E.g. height and weight

* Interval scale:
    - Units are equally spaced, but there is no true zero

* Ordinal scale:
    - The order of the unit is important, but not evenly spacedaced.
    - Letter grades such as A+,A are a good example

* Nominal scale:
    - Categories of data, but the categories have no order with
      respect to one another.
    - E.g. Teams of a sport.
